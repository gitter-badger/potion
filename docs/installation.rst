============

Install Flask-Potion using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install flask-potion


Flask-Potion requires Python version 2.7 or 3.3+. It works best with Python 3.x.

If you are using SQLAlchemy for your backend, you should also install Flask-SQLAlchemy. For any backend you use,
you'll need to also install their respective packages.
